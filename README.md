# Howdy
 Like Rumsfeld said, I know what I know, I don't know what I don't know, but I do know about some of the things I don't know. I've worked on primarily web-based software since the late '90s.

## What Motivates Me

- **I want to be the best at what I do**. I need the people around me to be the best at their jobs. I want world-class everything all the time, and I am unrelenting in this pursuit. I want our company to be the best. If I've invested my time with you, it's not for us to settle for second place.

## What Demotivates Me

- **I want everyone to be the best.** When I notice consistent sub-world-class level operation I become frustrated. It is inaccurate to say this demotivates me. I am likely to become more direct, which may be misconstrued as aggressive, in this situation.
- **I don't like hearing that I did something wrong through the grapevine.** Did I f*ck up? Would you please tell me directly? When I get feedback about something I did that someone didn't like through the grapevine I usually take a vacation.
- **I do not enjoy spending all day in meetings.** There are _usually_ better things to do. Sometimes calls are necessary. I don't like them at the beginning of the day, I don't like them at the end of the day. The best way to schedule a call with me is to check my calendar (if you're working with me already) or use my [wadewilliams.com/contact link](https://wadewilliams.com/contact/)

## Communication Preferences

- **Email**: I get back to email sometimes fast and sometimes slow.
- **Slack**: I'm on Slack nearly all waking hours. I won't respond quickly if it's before 9AM Mountain Time. You ought to expect a response within 20 minutes most other times.
  - Unless it's a private conversation, don't DM me please.
  - If you have direct feedback for me, please DM me please: "can we talk?" and I will zoom you ASAP.
- **SMS/Phone**: If you couldn't raise me on slack, it's unlikely that phone will work better. I do not answer calls from unknown numbers, and my phone is always on silent.
- **Zoom**: If you would like to schedule a call with me you can use my [wadewilliams.com/contact link](https://wadewilliams.com/contact/)

_Note:_ This is on the internet, don't bother spamming me, I'll block you before you know I blocked you :trollface:

## Flaws

1. My wit is acerbic; my humor is dry.
2. I get excited about gifs and can go overboard sometimes.
5. Sumtimz eye spelle wrang, specially in slack, and on porpoise.
3. Sometimes I obfuscate my opinion either for humor (see 1.) _or_ because I want people to think for themselves and draw their own conclusions. It's good to say what you think.
3. When I'm in a rush, I tend to spend little time crafting my words, which can be misinterpreted as disrespectful. It's good to say, "I don't mind you making that point, but your tone doesn't make me feel respected."
4. I care _a lot about the issues_. I am constantly seeking to improve the state of the world.
5. I do not suffer fools well. If I'm working with you, I will attempt to explain things approximately twice. As my father used to say, "You don't get Three". If I detect a lack of competence I will become more aggressive in pursuing the thread, usually to the detriment of all parties, including myself.


## My Values (and what I value in others)
1. Accountability
1. Integrity
1. Pursuit of Excellence
1. Responsiveness
1. Transparency

## My Blind Spots

- I say what I think. I do think about what I say, and I could be a politician if I spent all my time working on it, but I do not.
- I think what I do is good, because I want it to be good, and I consider what I'm doing perhaps more than the average bear.
- I expect direct communication, and I am direct in my communication. What I call direct sometimes is interpreted as aggressive. I'm never aggressive towards people, but I'm most certainly aggressive about ideas. If you think I'm being aggressive toward you it's OK to say "I don't mind you making that point, but your tone doesn't make me feel good."

## My Pet Peeves

- Expecting an inconsistent response time from the wrong [communication](#communication) channel
- Lack of consideration
- Lack of care
- Lack of due diligence
- Posting non-sequitur comments in the wrong slack channel

## Preferred Working Style

1. I work 100% remotely.
2. I do my best-focused knowledge work in the mornings.
3. I'm usually mulling through random things in the afternoon.
4. When I get sucked into a project, I will stay up all night and sleep in the next day.
5. I can make morning meetings, but I prefer meetings in the afternoon for the above reasons.
6. I have two children, and they occupy my non-working hour.
7. I am online almost all the time and nearly impatiently waiting for someone to say something in slack so I can think and respond.


## Other
- I appreciate direct feedback. I am unflappable, you can tell me anythin, you think and I will seriously consider it
- I care a lot about the work. I don't care for people who don't care.


- I say what I think. Sometimes this can come off as inapproprate or aggressive, but I do it because I care about the _issue_
- I do not believe that I am aggressive towards people. Sometimes I can come off as aggressively for/against an idea, but that must not be misconstrued as intended towards any individual.
- I give a shit about the issues
- I want to push for Excellence
- It's not my intention offend or diminish
-
- It's not my intention to be aggresive towards people. Sometimes I may come off agressively for/against an idea, but that does not mean I'm trying to be aggressive towards a person.

## Trivia
- I was born in Boston, I lived in Florida for 10 years, I lived in Arizona for 5 years, and I've lived in Wyoming since 2016. Minus a stint in Nepal for 3 months as a transitional period. I've spent time in 47/50 states.
