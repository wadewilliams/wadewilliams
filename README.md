# Howdy ðŸ‘‹

Like Rumsfeld said,

>  I know what I know, I don't know what I don't know, but I do know about some of the things I don't know.â€ 

I grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts. "Lynn, Lynn, the city of sin, you never go out the way you come in." That's how the saying goes. The last 13 generations of my family lived there, and the most recent five generations were Lynn Fire Department. My mother worked at the Apple store in the '80s, and my father got himself off the truck and into building LFD payroll processing systemsâ€ â€  when I was young.

Fire Department work is nothing that I've ever personally done; however, I've come to understand that my great grandfather wrote the book _Fire Fighting_. So, you can anticipate that I share some of the same intensity that you might expect from someone who volunteers to go into burning buildings for a living. You know, you could die at work. That's normal ðŸ¥´


# Wade's User Manual

_Here are some ways to help me work with you better._


## Flaws
1. My wit is acerbic; my humor is dry ðŸ‘€
2. I get excited about gifs. Sometimes I go overboard ðŸ™ƒ
3. Sumtimz eye spelle wrang, specially in Slack, and on porpoise :trollface:
4. Sometimes, I obfuscate my opinion for purposes of either humor (see 1.) or because I want you to _think for yourself_ and draw your own conclusions. In the latter case, I'm waiting to hear what you think ðŸ˜… It's good to say what you think ðŸ’¬
5. Sometimes, I spend little time crafting my words (especially on Slack). Which may be misinterpreted as disrespectful. If this happens, it's OK to say, "I don't mind you making that point, but your tone doesn't make me feel good." ðŸ¤—
6. I do not suffer fools well â›”
    - If I'm working with you, I will attempt to explain things approximately twice. As my father used to say, "You don't get Three."
    - When I detect what appears to me as low competence, I tend to salvo challenges in a genuine attempt to allow the user to disprove my hypothesis of their capability.
    - If this happens to you, read my words as asking you to either tell me that I'm wrong or take responsibility for the lapse.
    - It's OK to say "Got it" and fix the issue, and it's OK to say "You're wrong because [reasons]."
    - You will negatively affect my view of your capability level by saying "Got it" and not fixing it.
7. Before we've built a relationship, I may seem like I don't care for you ðŸ’” I may be curt, especially when I'm busy. If you want to earn my respect, then communicate and show your work. You do not need to demonstrate this to me directly -- I need only observe your work for my trust to build in you. My closest friends use words to describe me that I would never use, like "accessible and empathetic and loyal" ðŸ¤· Really? Cool.

## Preferred Working Style

1. I work 100% remotely.
2. I do my best-focused knowledge work in the mornings.
3. I'm usually mulling through random things in the afternoon.
4. When I get sucked into a specific thing, I might stay up all night and sleep the next day. I'll let you know when this happens so I won't miss anything important.
5. I can make morning meetings, but I prefer meetings in the afternoon for the above reasons.
6. I have two children, and they occupy my non-working hour.
7. I am online almost all the time and nearly impatiently waiting for someone to say something in Slack so I can think and respond.


## What Motivates Me
<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/daftpunktocat-thomas.gif" align="right" height="350" width="350" style="margin-top:2em"/>

- **I want to be the best at what I do**. I need the people around me to be the best at their jobs. I want world-class everything all the time, and I am unrelenting in this pursuit. I want our company to be the best. If I've invested my time with you, it's not for us to settle for second place.
- **I need direct feedback**. I am unflappable, you can tell me anything you think, and I will seriously consider it. You cannot be afraid to tell me what you think. I crave it, and it will help us build a better relationship.
- **I am hard on issues**. I say what I think. Sometimes this can come off as inappropriate or aggressive. I do it because I care about the _issue_. The issue is the issue; I want us to be successful together.
- **Strong Opinions, Loosely Held**. I have opinions; I'm sure you do too. Please convince me that you're right. Sometimes, I come in hot and say XYZ. Fifty-one percent of me believes this, forty-nine percent of me is trying to convince you. If you have a better logical argument, I will be 100% on your side in a heartbeat.

## What Demotivates Me

- **I don't feel productive after a full day of meetings.** There are _usually_ better things to do. Sometimes calls are necessary. I don't like them at the beginning of the day, and I don't like them at the end of the day.
- **I don't react well to hearing that I did something wrong through the grapevine.** Did I f*ck up? Could you please tell me directly? When I hear about something you didn't like about me, my performance, or my behavior from a third party, I will become disengaged and trust you less. But, on the other hand, if you are direct with me, I will respond positively to you.
- **I don't care for people who don't care.** When I notice consistent sub-world-class level operation, I become frustrated. It is inaccurate to say this demotivates me. I am likely to become more direct, which may be misconstrued as aggressive, in this situation.

## My Values (and what I value in others)
1. **Honesty** I am going to tell you what I think. I expect you to tell me what you think, and I want to hear it from you.
1. **Iteration** Tomorrow will be better than today, and today is better than yesterday. The math says that compound interest pays more dividends than short-term efforts.
1. **Responsiveness** I do my best to be as responsive as possible - as if I'm in the same room as you. I don't expect everyone to be online all the time, but if you are online, I may become annoyed with a non-similar-ish response time to my own [communication preferences](#communication-preferences)
1. **Transparency** Share your work, early and often. If I can't see it, I assume it doesn't exist.
1. **Trust** We have to trust each other to work well together.

## My Blind Spots

- **I say what I think.** I _do think about what I say_, and I _could_ be a politician if I spent all my time working on it, but I do not. Sometimes, especially when I'm on deadline for deliverables, I spend far less time thinking about what I say. If this comes off as abrasive, it's good to say, "Did you mean [paraphrase]?"
- **I think what I do is good.** I am considerate about issues, and the work I do aims to solve those issues. But, I can convince myself that my approach is the best without input. Sometimes, I need a different perspective, well-articulated, to help me understand how my work can be better.
- I expect direct communication, and I am candid when communicating. It's easy for emotions to be lost through text on the internet. Sometimes  I'm never aggressive towards people, but I'm fierce about ideas. If you think I'm aggressive toward you, it's OK to say, "I don't mind you making that point, but your tone doesn't make me feel good."


## Communication Preferences

My response time will be lagging if it's before 9 AM Mountain Time. I'm also slow to respond between 5 PM-8 PM Mountain.

- **Email**: I get back to email sometimes fast and sometimes slow.
  - _Expect a reply within one week._
- **Slack**: I'm on Slack nearly all waking hours.
  - _Expect a reply within 20 minutes_.
  - Unless it's a private conversation, _don't DM me, please_. There's a public channel for that.
  - If you have direct feedback for me, _**please** DM me, please_: "can we talk?" and I will zoom you in ASAP.
- **SMS/Phone**: If you couldn't raise me on Slack, it's unlikely that phone will work better. I do not answer calls from unknown numbers, and my phone is always on silent.
  - _Expect a reply time between 8 - âˆž hours if I don't have your number_
  - _Expect a reply within 3 hours if you call/text me and I have your number._
- **Zoom**: The best way to schedule a call with me is to check my calendar (if you're working with me already) or use my [wadewilliams.com/contact link](https://wadewilliams.com/contact/)

_Note:_ This is the internet, don't bother spamming me, I've blocked you before you knew I blocked you :trollface:

## My Pet Peeves

- Expecting an inconsistent response time from the wrong [communication](#communication) channel
- Lack of consideration
- Lack of care
- Lack of due diligence
- Posting non-sequitur comments in the wrong Slack channel

â€ â€  Yeah, he's still pissed off about leap years.
