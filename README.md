# Howdy ðŸ‘‹

Like Rumsfeld said,

>  I know what I know, I don't know what I don't know, but I do know about some of the things I don't know.â€ 

I grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts. "Lynn, Lynn, the city of sin, you never go out the way you come in." That's how the saying goes. The last 13 generations of my family lived there and the last 5 generations were Lynn Fire Department. My mother worked at the Apple store in the 80's and my father shifted over to build out the payroll processing systems for the Fire Department while my brother and I were growing up in the late 80s. Fire Department work is nothing that I've ever personally done but since my great grandfather wrote the book _Fire Fighting_, you can expect that I share some of the same values.

Here's some words about how to work with me better.

## What Motivates Me

<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/daftpunktocat-thomas.gif" align="right" height="350" width="350" style="margin-top:2em"/>

- **I want to be the best at what I do**. I need the people around me to be the best at their jobs. I want world-class everything all the time, and I am unrelenting in this pursuit. I want our company to be the best. If I've invested my time with you, it's not for us to settle for second place.
- **I need direct feedback**. I am unflappable, you can tell me anything you think and I will seriously consider it.
- **I am hard on issues**. I say what I think. Sometimes this can come off as inappropriate or aggressive, but I do it because I care about the _issue_.
- I do not believe that I am aggressive towards people. Sometimes I can come off as aggressively for/against an idea, but that must not be misconstrued as intended towards any individual.
- I give a shit about the issues
- I want to push for Excellence
- It's not my intention offend or diminish
- It's not my intention to be aggresive towards people. Sometimes I may come off aggressively for/against an idea, but that does not mean I'm trying to be aggressive towards a person.


## What Demotivates Me

- **I don't care for people who don't care.** When I notice consistent sub-world-class level operation I become frustrated. It is inaccurate to say this demotivates me. I am likely to become more direct, which may be misconstrued as aggressive, in this situation.
- **I don't like hearing that I did something wrong through the grapevine.** Did I f*ck up? Could you please tell me directly? When I get feedback about something I did that someone didn't like through the grapevine I can check out.
- **I don't feel productive after a full day of meetings.** There are _usually_ better things to do. Sometimes calls are necessary. I don't like them at the beginning of the day, I don't like them at the end of the day.

## Communication Preferences

I won't respond quickly if it's before 9AM Mountain Time. I'm also slow to respond between 5PM-8PM Mountain.

- **Email**: I get back to email sometimes fast and sometimes slow.
  - _Expect a reply within 1 week._
- **Slack**: I'm on Slack nearly all waking hours.
  - _Expect a reply within 20 minutes_.
  - Unless it's a private conversation, _don't DM me please_.
  - If you have direct feedback for me, _**please** DM me please_: "can we talk?" and I will zoom you ASAP.
- **SMS/Phone**: If you couldn't raise me on Slack, it's unlikely that phone will work better. I do not answer calls from unknown numbers, and my phone is always on silent.
  - _Expect a reply time between 8 - âˆž hours if I don't have your number_
  - _Expect a reply within 3 hours if you call/text me and I have your number._
- **Zoom**: The best way to schedule a call with me is to check my calendar (if you're working with me already) or use my [wadewilliams.com/contact link](https://wadewilliams.com/contact/)

_Note:_ This is the internet, don't bother spamming me, I've blocked you before you knew I blocked you :trollface:

## Flaws

- **Strong Opinions, Loosely Held**.
1. My wit is acerbic; my humor is dry ðŸ‘€
2. I get excited about gifs. Sometimes I go overboard ðŸ™ƒ
5. Sumtimz eye spelle wrang, specially in Slack, and on porpoise :trollface:
3. Sometimes I obfuscate my opinion for purposes of either humor (see 1.) _or because I want people to think for themselves_ and draw their own conclusions. It's good to say what you think ðŸ’¬
3. Sometimes I spend little time crafting my words (especially on Slack), which can be misinterpreted as disrespectful. If this happens, it's OK to say "I don't mind you making that point, but your tone doesn't make me feel good" ðŸ¤—
4. I sometimes make people feel like I am
5. I do not suffer fools well.
  - If I'm working with you, I will attempt to explain things approximately twice.
  - As my father used to say, "You don't get Three".
  - When I detect what appears to me as low competence, I tend to salvo challenges in a genuine attempt to allow the user to disprove my hypothesis of their capability.
  - When this happens I am asking you to either tell me that I'm wrong or take responsibility for the lapse.
  - It's OK to say "Got it", and fix the issue, and it's OK to say "You're wrong because [reasons]".
  - You will negatively affect my attitude towards you by saying "Got it" and not fixing it.


## My Values (and what I value in others)
1. **Honesty** I'll tell you what I think. I expect you to tell me what you think.
1. **Iteration** Tomorrow will be better than today, and today is better than yesterday. In an ideal world we solve issues once and never again. In reality, compound improvements will yield far better results than short-term focus.
1. **Responsiveness** I don't expect everyone to be online all the time, but if you are online, I expect a similar-ish response time to my own.
1. **Transparency** Share your work, early and often. If I can't see it, I assume it doesn't exist.
1. **Trust** We have to trust each other in order to work well together.

## My Blind Spots

- **I say what I think.** I _do think about what I say_, and I _could_ be a politician if I spent all my time working on it, but I do not. Sometimes you'll get exactly what I think. It's OK to say "Is that what you really meant?"
- **I think what I do is good.** I am considerate about issues and the work I do aims to solve those issues. Sometimes I need a different perspective, well articulated, to help me understand how my work can be better.
- I expect direct communication, and I am direct in my communication. What I call direct sometimes is interpreted as aggressive. I'm never aggressive towards people, but I'm most certainly aggressive about ideas. If you think I'm being aggressive toward you it's OK to say "I don't mind you making that point, but your tone doesn't make me feel good."

## My Pet Peeves

- Expecting an inconsistent response time from the wrong [communication](#communication) channel
- Lack of consideration
- Lack of care
- Lack of due diligence
- Posting non-sequitur comments in the wrong Slack channel

## Preferred Working Style

<img src="https://wadewilliams.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jul07_l.jpg" align="right" width="400" height="529"/>

1. I work 100% remotely.
2. I do my best-focused knowledge work in the mornings.
3. I'm usually mulling through random things in the afternoon.
4. When I get sucked into a project, I will stay up all night and sleep in the next day.
5. I can make morning meetings, but I prefer meetings in the afternoon for the above reasons.
6. I have two children, and they occupy my non-working hour.
7. I am online almost all the time and nearly impatiently waiting for someone to say something in Slack so I can think and respond.
