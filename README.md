### Hi I'm Wade ðŸ‘‹

 Like Rumsfeld said, I know what I know, I don't know what I don't know, and I know some of the things I don't know. I was born in Boston, I lived in Florida for 10 years, I lived in Arizona for 5 years, and I've lived in Wyoming since 2016. Minus a stint in Nepal for 3 months as a transitional period. I've worked on primarily web based software since the late 90's.

## How to Contact Me

 My email is on the left. I get back to email sometimes fast and sometimes slow. Don't send me random spam. If you need me, use a medium that is not email, like SMS or Slack.

## Preferred Working Style

I'm usually trying to get focused work done in the morning, and I'm usually mulling through random things in the afternoon. I have 2 children and they occupy my non-working hour. All that being said I'm adicted to slack and I am mostly online all the time and almost impatient for someone to say something in slack so I can think and respond.

I am **_hard on issues_**. If something sucks, I will say it. I **do not** aim to be hard on people. If I come off as being abbraisive, it's not intentional. Keep reading.

## What Motivates Me

I want to be the best. I want the people around me to be the best. I want world class everything all the time, and can be unrelenting in my pursuit of this goal. It doesn't really matter what the subject domain is, I want us to be the best at it. If I've invested my time in the space, it's not to settle for second place. 

## What Demotivates Me

- **I do not enjoy spending all day in meetings.** There are _usually_ better things to do. Sometimes calls are necessary. I don't like them at the beginning of the day, I don't like them at the end of the day. The best way to schedule a call with me is to check my calendar (if you're working with me already) _or_ use my calendly link, which takes all of this into account.
- **I do not suffer fools well.** If I'm working with you, I will attempt to explain things approximately twice. As my father used to say, "You don't get Three". If I detect a lack of competence I will become more aggressive in pursuing the thread, usually to the detriment of all parties, including myself. 
- **I want everyone to be the best.** Combining the last several points, when people are consistently operating at a low level I become frustrated. It is inaccurate to say this demotivates me. I am likely to become more direct, which may be misconstrued as aggressive, in this situation. 

## My Values (and what I value in others)
- Pursuit of Excellence
- Integrity
- Responsiveness
- Accountability

## My Blind Spots

- I say what I think. I do think about what I say, and I could be a politician if I spent all my time working on it, but I do not. 
- I think what I do is good, because I want it to be good, and I consider what I'm doing perhaps more than the average bear. 

## My Pet Peeves

- Posting a non-sequitor comment in the wrong slack channel
- Expecting an inconsistent response time from the wrong communication channel
- Lack of consideration
- Lack of care
- Lack of due dilligence

## Other
- I appreciate direct feedback. I am unflappable, you can tell me anythin, you think and I will seriously consider it
- I say what I think. Sometimes this can come off as inapproprate or aggressive, but I do it because I care about the _issue_
- I do not believe that I am aggressive towards people. Sometimes I can come off as aggressively for/against an idea, but that must not be misconstrued as 
intended towards any individual.
- I care a lot about the work. I don't care for people who don't care.
